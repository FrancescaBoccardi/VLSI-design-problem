# VLSI-design-problem

In recent years, Very Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) has been a well known problem: it is the process of organizing millions or even billions of electronic components in order to fit more of them in a given area.
Considering the increasing number of components that are involved, it is necessary to address these problems with smart and efficient techniques.

This repository describes three different Combinatorial Optimization approaches to the VLSI problem:

* Constraint Programming (CP)
* Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)
* Mixed Integer-Linear Programming (MIP)

## Repository structure

The repository contains one folder for each of the three used technologies :
